# reshape-state

A small [state management library](libs/reshape-state/README.md). Use a reshaper to manage acquiring data for a state object from multiple asynchronous sources.

Also an [example React application](apps/example-app/src/main.tsx).

## Publish

The `build` steps will generate publishable lib output to the `dist` directory. Use the np command in the workspace root directory (same as this file):

```bash
./node_modules/.bin/np
```
